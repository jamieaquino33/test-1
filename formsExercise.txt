Forms Exercise…
1. Create a new folder inside of your Forms folder named “FormsExercise”
2. Create a new file in the FormsExercise folder called formsExercise.html
3. Recreate Customer Experience Survey form page using the TWO images below
Notes about elements/inputs on page...
The “Store Number” dropdown options are 3109, 2421, & 5357
“Name” and “Email” are both placeholder text
The columns and rows lengths for the “Tell us about…” are 20 and 2
The “Times visited…” input is a number input

BONUS…
Have “Select A Store” display in the “Store Number” dropdown when the page loads. Also, when the dropdown is clicked do NOT display “Select A Store” as an option to select.
Set the range for “Date Visited” so that it must be within this year (AKA 2022)
Have “Neither Satisfied nor Dissatisfied” selected by default when the page loads
Set the range for “Times visited…” from 1 and 30
Set up the “Please check…” checkbox so that it needs to be checked for the form to be submitted
Create a password input below the checkbox input. Set a minimum and maximum length for the password input that is 5 and 10 characters. Also have the following message display when user has not met the minimum and maximum length requirements (HINT: Pattern)…
“Please enter a password that is 5 to 10 characters in length”
Include a Reset input before the Submit input at the bottom

When finished, create a repository in the “FormsExercise” Folder as well as on GitHub. Add and commit everything in the FormsExercise folder and push it up to your GitHub repository. Then paste the link to your GitHub repository page in the form.
